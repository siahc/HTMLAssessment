# HTMLAssessment

#### User is taken to an online shop for plants and is able to learn about what an epiphyte is (filler text included).
This page is to simulate a form that may be found at an online plant store. User is able to see how much prices have
increased in Monsteras and Anthuriums during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
User is able so see a list of two opposing popular aroids as many people are "Team Monstera" or "Team Anthurium"
and can read a list of rare speacies of each. 

This exercise was helpful in making me become more familiarized with HTML and it seems to be very intuitive language for the most part.
I struggled on creating the list as the columns and rows can be difficult to concepturalize, but feel as though
I have accomplished this goal. 
I also had to pay atention to my anchor tag and make sure my href had the proper syntax inside.
